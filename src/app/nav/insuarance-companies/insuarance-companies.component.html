    <div class="Insurance">
        <p class="char-count">Over the last two decades, the insurance industry has shown immense growth in India. This
            is probably <span class="extra-text-show-extra"> because of the main reason that almost every insurance
                company supported their customers </span><span class="extra-text-web-show-extra"> by providing a high
                claim settlement ratio. At present, many insurance companies offer several types of policies with
                various benefits to help protect people as per their budget and convenience. </span></p>

    <div class="block_content_wrapper">
        <p class="paragraphBu">The best part of an insurance policy is, it provides financial aid depending upon the
            specific requirement of an individual, this can vary from person to person, and what could be beneficial for
            someone can turn out to be totally useless for someone else.</p>
        <p class="paragraphBu">For any individual who is a newbie to this field, the concept of insurance seems a little
            complex. Let us simplify it a bit for you all - when you buy an insurance policy, you come into a contract
            with the insurer to provide you with financial aid in return for this you are required to pay off regular
            premiums. The insurance policy protects you against the uncertain events of life which might leave adverse
            effects on you or your family.</p>
        <p class="paragraphBu">Also, what makes insurance a little complex is so many varieties to choose from and the
            calculation for the policy period, cover amount, premium pay, etc. However, you can make a decision of
            buying term insurance by doing thorough research online. You can compare plans, benefits, limitations, along
            with the comparison between top-notch insurance companies- this can help you make a better decision based on
            your requirements and future life goals.</p>
        <p class="paragraphBu"> Earlier, in India, only two Insurance companies were available, namelyâ€“ Life Insurance
            Corporation of India and General Insurance Corporation of India. However, now in India, the insurance
            industry has 34 General insurance companies and 24 life insurance companies with many benefits as well as
            customized offers to financially safeguard individuals against life's uncertain events. Many companies have
            joined their hands with international firms to provide better service to people.</p>
